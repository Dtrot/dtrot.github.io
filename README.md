Created my GitHub account for CTI-110 assignments and other tasks in the future.
A GitHub repository is like a folder for a project that can contain all of the project files, such as documentation, code, and data. It also stores each files revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. They also provide features for discussion and version control management.
Downloaded Desktop GitHub and installed it on my machine. Logged in to Desktop Github with my GitHub credetials. Clicked on "+" and selected "Clone a repository". Selected from the list of repositories "dtrot.github.io" to clone.
